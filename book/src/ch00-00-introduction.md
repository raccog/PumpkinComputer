# Introduction

This book currently describes my plans for the Pumpkin Computer. These plans are not set in stone.

The Pumpkin Computer is an open-source implementation of a RISC-V processing environment and operating system from
scratch. One of the main goals of this project is to contain both an HDL implementation of
a processor and a desktop operating system to run on it.
