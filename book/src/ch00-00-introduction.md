# Introduction

This book currently describes my plans for the Pumpkin Computer.

The Pumpkin Computer is an open-source implementation of a CPU and operating system from scratch. One of the main goals of this project is to contain both an HDL implementation of
a CPU (including its peripherals) and a desktop operating system to run on it.

Chapter 1 describes the CPU.

Chapter 2 describes the Operating System.

Chapter 3 describes the Userland programs.
