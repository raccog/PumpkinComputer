# Userland

The first set of software will be very minimal. The goal of this first set is to demonstrate the initial operating system and CPU capabilities.

## Program List

- a nano-like text editor (if possible using a UART for I/O)
- a minimal shell language
- grep implementation
- resource monitor
- calculator language
- system log reader

## Development Plan

Though I am currently focusing on the CPU, I can start the userland programs by creating Linux userland examples.
